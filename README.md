# Data Science with Python

Welcome to my data science journey using Python!

This repository is a collection of beginner-to-intermediate projects and practice files focused on building real skills in data science. Whether you're exploring data for the first time or sharpening your programming edge, you'll find useful examples, clear explanations, and hands-on code.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn
- Data analysis with `pandas` and `NumPy`
- Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques
- Preprocessing and cleaning messy datasets
- Machine learning fundamentals with `scikit-learn`

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 💡 About This Project
This is not just about code—it's about growth, curiosity, and practical learning. I'm building this as part of my journey toward becoming a cybersecurity and ethical hacking professional, with a strong foundation in Python and data analysis.
